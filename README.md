# classCentral
Task Details - 
 This project is a trial task given by Coding AllStars for Jr. Python Developer Role.
In this project I was assigned to do a 1 Level Scrape on the website "www.classcentral.com" and gather all the HTML and CSS of the website.
Then we had to make a script that converts all the text in the website from english to hindi.
After that, we needed to deploy the webpage on the internet.

My Procedure -
I used selenium for web scraping as it was a dynamic page.
Then, I made a python script for translation of the text and finally the website was deployed on github.
